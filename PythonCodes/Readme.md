Introduction:
In this experiment, we have used 2 micrometer silica particles.
We are setting up a n=10 circular trap using the code axicon.py
We are setting up the motion of the piezo stage with parameters as shown below:
 
 







Experiment: trying to make the trap perfect circle
1.
 

 
 
 


Finally, I did achieve a quite good circle with the values in axicon.py, although it still can be optimized, is a 2d search problem. Must be noted, what Iâ€™m trying to do here is orient the center of the spiral with the incoming beam. This will give a good cylindrical Bessel beam.
