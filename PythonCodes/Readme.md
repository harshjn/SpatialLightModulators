Introduction:
In this experiment, we are trying to align incoming beam with the axicon pattern of our SLM.
We are setting up a n=10 circular trap using the code axicon.py
We have to experiment and try to make the trap perfect circular Laguerre Gaussian beam.

Finally, I did achieve a quite good circle with the values in axicon.py, although it still can be optimized, is a 2d search problem. Must be noted, what Iâ€™m trying to do here is orient the center of the spiral with the incoming beam. This will give a good cylindrical beam.
