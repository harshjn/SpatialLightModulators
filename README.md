# Optical patterns calculated for SpatialLightModulators
Various codes for projecting phase distributions on to a phase-controlling spatial light modulator such as the Hamamatsu LCOS - SLM. (https://www.hamamatsu.com/us/en/product/optical-components/lcos-slm.html)
To get a target pattern such as an optical tweezers trap, the projection pattern for the SLM needs to be back calculated using algorithms such as GS Algorithm. 
Here, we present MATLAB and PYTHON codes for calculating and projecting such patterns for an SLM recognized as an extended display.
